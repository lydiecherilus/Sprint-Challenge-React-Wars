 1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a UI library. 
If the page has data that changes over time at high rates, 
then there is a requirement for DOM updates to be very fast 
and also reflect in other parts of the UI if they use the same data. 
React solves this problem, without even having the page reload.

 2. What does it mean to think in react?

Is to break The UI Into a component hierarchy
always run the same function that was used for the initial 
rendering to get the updated interface.

 3. Describe state.

A state is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves.

 4. Describe props.
In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. 

 5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

 A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed.
 We sync effects by passing in a dependency array as the second argument to the effect hook.
